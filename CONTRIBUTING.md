# Contributing 

While SvelteQuest is not currently open to free contribution (as it is a learning tool more than anything else), there's no specific embargo about outside contributors. If you would like to join up and write some killer code and some cool articles to boot, send me an email at jack.dixon.ryan@gmail.com.

## Rules for Contribution
SvelteQuest's rules for contribution are, for now, pretty straightforward: 

### For Code
1. Pull before push. 
2. Review your code before PRing and asking for a review. 
3. Make sure the code does what you think it does.
4. Run the application locally. Make sure it builds. Make sure your changes don't cause crashes. 
5. If you're writing complicated `lib` code, consider writing tests. 
6. Document your changes, either in article form, notes, or code comments. Preferably, all three. 
7. Don't cut corners- unless you really, really need to cut a corner.

### For Articles 
1. Proofread. I know we're not English majors but the best way to _not_ get taken seriously is to have incorrect grammar. 
2. Don't skip steps. If you had to do it, _write it out._ The smallest clerical changes can equate directly to the reader coming out of the tutorial with a broken replica.
3. Include full snippets. If a snippet has requirements to run, include those requirements in the snippet. Yeah, it takes up page space, but people will copy/paste snippets, and react negatively if the snippet doesn't work. 
4. Link directly to the GH branch that corresponds with what you're writing. Sometimes articles are confusing and GH makes it clear. 

## Why the Rules? 
SvelteQuest is a learning tool so that both readers and contributors can get a better understanding for how Svelte works, and a better understanding of best practices in web development. Clean, well-constructed, well-thought-out code should satisfy industry standards for code quality, security best practices, and accessibility best practices. SvelteQuest's take (which is to say, my hot take) is that too many articles on Medium are written to get page views, or dev clout, or LinkedIn Profile views, and not much more than that. Too many articles are rushed out hastily; they are sloppily written, poorly thought-out, and include incorrect or invalid code. Yet there are _tons_ of writers on Medium who are creating amazing content, and SvelteQuest wants to be one of them. What's more infuriating than following a tutorial to learn it doesn't run, doesn't build, doesn't do what it says it does, or doesn't follow best practices? SQ's goal is to leave developers with working applications and a good understanding of what they've built. Clean code and clear writing are the best ways to accomplish this goal.
